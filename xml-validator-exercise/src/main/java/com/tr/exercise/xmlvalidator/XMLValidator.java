 *
 * XML Validator
 * =============
 *
 * The problem:
 * We have a directory that contains a number of XML files with important data that needs to be imported so the
 * update are available to our customers. However, we don't if these XML files are well formed.  We only want to
 * import valid files so we need to identify them.  The XML files and the XSD are in the resources/xml-files
 * directory.
 *
 * The task:
 * Write a program to validate the XML files against the XSD and produce a log file that includes the names of any
 * invalid files.  The program will take one argument as input which is the directory location of the files.  There
 * will only ever be one XSD file in the directory.  A main method has been provided for you below.
 *
 * NOTE: no file names should be hard-coded.
 *
 * Think about the use of your program:
 *
 *  - could there be issues with your implementation?
 *  - what improvements would you make?
 *  - is your design flexible for any requirement changes?
 *  - what about the performance of your program?
 *
 * Note down any thoughts/comments you have.
